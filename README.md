## What are Dotfiles?

 
Dotfiles are plain text configuration files on Unix-y systems for things like our shell or our editor. If you're not familiar with the concept of dotfiles, check out [Github's dotfiles page](https://dotfiles.github.io/) to learn more about them.

The name dotfiles refers to the fact that most of the files that perform this sort of configuration start with a dot. The dot or ‘.’ in front of the file means that it is actually a hidden file on the system, although this is not a strict requirement. The Zsh configuration file, for example, is `.zshrc` The SSH configuration folder is `.ssh` And so on. So the concept of "dotfiles" just means "versioning your configuration files".

> to actually see these files, you either have to enable the ability to view those hidden files (if you are using a gui file viewer) or you have to use a specific flag (-a) on the command line with ls

Your dotfiles will help you create powerful and consistent shell shortcuts and functions, settings for your editors, color coding and layouts for your shell, preferences and authentication for ssh and mysql and other protocols, and more.

**Warning:** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk!

## Superhero Dotfiles and Their Super Powers

Dotfiles are split into two main types. Those that contain a set of commands and only run once, `.osx` for example runs a list of commands and gives OS X super powers. Other files such as `.bash_profile` and `.bashrc` run each time you open a new Terminal session and gives your Terminal super powers.

Here's a run down of some of the most popular and a description of what they can do:

 - `.bash_profile` / `.bashrc`: When you open a new Terminal session, this file is loaded by Bash. It loads in the other dotfiles `path,bash_prompt,exports,aliases,functions,extra` and configures some useful settings such as auto correcting typos when using cd completion.
In some instances `.bashrc` can be loaded, so this file makes sure that `.bash_profile` is called.
 - `.path`: This file speeds up the process of running executable files. Rather than having to cd back and forth across various paths to executable files, you can set the file paths in your `.path` dotilfe and then run executable files directly.
 > Generally, this file isn't held in the public repo as it can contain sensitive information.
 Here’s an example `~/.path` file that adds `~/utils` to the `$PATH:
 ```
 export PATH="$HOME/utils:$PATH"
 ```

 - `.bash_prompt`: Using this file you can customise and set the various colors of your Bash prompt.
 - `.exports`: Sets environment variables, such as setting Vim as the default editor using export `EDITOR="sublime"` It also increases the amount of history saved, useful for backtracking over previous commands you've used.
 - `.aliases`: This file contains useful aliases to help you write less. For example, instead of typing `cd ..` you can set it here to be '..'. Starting to like these files yet?
 - `.functions`: Similar to aliases, except functions can take arguments. Before when I mentioned I was looking over different dotfile repos, I did mkdir to create a directory. After that, I'd then need to cd into that directory.
 - `.gitconfig`: This file is only used by Git, for example, when a git command is invoked. So although there's an `.aliases` file, those aliases are run directly.
 - `.gitignore`: Set files that you'd like Git to ignore on the entire system. Yay, no more `.DS_Store` being accidentally committed!
 - `.gvimrc`: A small file that improves readability for gvim.
 - `.hgignore`: Simliar to .gitignore for Mercurial.
 - `.hushlogin`: Usually when you connect to a server remotely, via ssh, you'll be shown the "message of the day", the last time you logged in to the machine, and other details. Here's a simple way to disable that behaviour. By default the display of the message of the day is read from the file `/etc/motd`. The obvious way to disable this behaviour is to remove this from the relevant PAM file(s). However doing this will remove the behaviour from all users of the machine - which might not be appreciated. Similarily, when you launch a new Terminal window or tab in Mac OS X (and most linux distributions) you’ll be greeted with a little message which is often a “last login” details. Having the `.hushlogin` file silent any messages. 
 > If you have configured your terminal to open a new tab with "Same Working Directory" enabled, the current directory is searched for `.hushlogin`. Unless you put a `.hushlogin` in every single directory, it will only see `~/.hushlogin` if you open a new tab when you're in `~`. This is in direct conflict with the feature of preserving the current working directory. 
 - `.inputrc`: Configures the 'Readline environment'. This controls the way keys work when you're entering a command into your shell. An example of how I find this useful is to make tab autocomplete regardless of filename case `set completion-ignore-case on`
 - `.osx`: This is my favorite of all the dotfiles. It is run once, manually, for the commands to run and take effect. Depending on what you've added to this file, you may need to restart your machine.
    
    Some of the awesome things I love are:

    - Disable the “Are you sure you want to open this application?” dialog
    - Check for software updates daily, not just once per week
    - Disable Notification Center and remove the menu bar icon
    - Enable access for assistive devices
    - Set a blazingly fast keyboard repeat rate
    - Finder: allow quitting via `⌘ + Q` doing so will also hide desktop icons
    - When performing a search, search the current folder by default
    - Speed up Mission Control animations

 - `.screenrc`: If you use screen, this removes the startup message.
 - `.vimrc`: I'm not that familiar with vim. However some of the things you can do with this file include enabling line numbers and adding syntax highlighting. For `vim` i have also included the [powerline](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline) visual styling which will include a status line.
 - `.wgetrc`: If you use wget, this adds additional settings such as changing the timeout to 60 seconds rather than the default 15 minutes. It also sets the retry to three, rather than the default 20!

## Getting Started

If you notice, some files that have mentioned above don't exist in this repo. This is because i am using the amazing [bash-it](http://github.com/ahmadassaf/bash-it) repo to organize those dotfiles.
I recommend you head overthere and read how to use them.d

## Installing the Scripts

For installing the above files outside of the workflow mentioned in the [main configurations](http://github.com/ahmadassaf/configurations), you need to run the following command `sh install.sh`. The command will symlink all the files in this directory into your home directory, overwriting existing files.

### Sensible OS X defaults

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible OS X defaults:

```bash
./.osx
```

### Install Homebrew formulae

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to install some common [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) formulae (after installing Homebrew, of course).
`brew bundle` has been deprecated, thus i converted the files into executable shell ones:

```bash
brew install ~/.brewfile.sh
```

you can always remove or add files based on yor preferences. You can search for brew formulas [here](http://brewformulas.org/) in order to add or get more information about the ones I am using.

My file contains the following `brew` formulas:

+ **Core Modules** coreutils, moreutils, findutils, binutils
+ **Bash, Bash plugins** bash, bash-completion, zsh, grc
+ **Development** git, heroku, node, mercurial, iojs
+ **Git speific addons** git-extras, hub, bfg
+ **Utilities** htop-osx, id3tool, lesspipe, ssh-copy-id, the_silver_searcher, tree, fcrackzip, foremost, ack, p7zip, pigz, pv, gnu-sed, vim, wget
+ **Network tools** dns2tcp, knock, rename, webkit2png
+ [**Dupes**](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-dupes) grep, screen

### Install native apps with `brew cask`

You could also install native apps with [`brew cask`](https://github.com/phinze/homebrew-cask):

```bash
brew install ~/.caskfile.sh
```

you can always remove or add files based on yor preferences. You can search for cask formulas [here](http://caskroom.io/) in order to add or get more information about the ones I am using.

My `cask` file contains the following applications:

+ **Utilities** path-finder, alfred, cakebrew, a-better-finder-rename, fastscripts, bettertouchtool, iterm2, launchrocket, gyazo, ubersicht, dockmod, liteicon, cleanmymac, bartender, flexiglass
+ **Productivity** todoist, evernote, mendeley-desktop, fantastical, slack, screenhero
+ **Development** sublime-text3, atom, sourcetree, github, brackets, coda, tower, transmission-remote-gui, macvim, sqlite-database-browser, lightpaper,
+ codebox, anvil, hex-fiend, ksdiff, codekit, MAMP
+ **Internet, Networking** firefox, google-chrome, charles, dropbox, google-drive, mailbox, viber, utorrent, plex-media-server
+ **Misc** vlc, imagealpha, imageoptim, steam, the-unarchiver, spotify, handbrake
