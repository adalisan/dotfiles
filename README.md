## Introduction
A collection of configs to be placed in the users home directory usually prefixed with a period, hence the name dotfiles.
This repo is actually intended for my personal backup, but everyone are welcome to use these resources. 
Maybe not always up to date with my current setup.
I also put some explanations in this README file, because people say they are interested with my setup. I hope this will be useful.
Also, please read what written inside the files before use. And remember, copying configuration file doesn't make it instantly work :wink: <br />

## Fvwm : Don't Try This at Home
![preview-fvwm](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-fvwm.jpg) <br />
I build this on top of [Mixed Fvwm Themes](http://www.vakuumverpackt.de/fvwm/). So, install it first. <br />
**Stuff in the screenshot** : Fvwm Pager, Minimized to Thumbnail module (Firefox, GIMP, and Evince), Thunar, vim inside termite, and ncmpcpp.  <br />
**Now Playing** : Beethoven - Moonlight Sonata <br /> <br />

## Explanations
- **Openbox** <br /> Some useful keybinds like snap window with useless gaps (super + arrows). MPC control using *play/pause, next, previous,* and *stop* keys. 
*Super + number* to switch workspace like in i3wm. *Super + shift + number* to send window to another workspace (also like in i3wm), and more keybinds. 
And a well commented *autostart* file is included. I only put one Openbox theme in this repo. 
My other Openbox themes is in [Openbox Theme Collections](https://github.com/addy-dclxvi/Openbox-Theme-Collections).

- **Other WMs** <br /> Pretty stock simple setup of i3, herbstluftwm, Bspwm, Fluxbox, Spectrwm, dwm & [xfwm-standalone](https://github.com/addy-dclxvi/xfwm4-standalone).

- **.profile and .xsessionrc** <br /> They are scripts those executed by LightDM when You login X session. Previously I use *.profile* file when I'm still on Arch. 
But, I found that *~/.profile* file is not executed by LightDM on Debian.
So, I use *~/.xsessionrc* file now (maybe *.xsessionrc* also work in Arch, I haven't tested it). 
It contains some command to export *~/.bar*, *~/.executor*, *~/.notify*, *~/.utility*, and some other folders to `$PATH`. 
It's important if You want to use my configurations. Because I centralized most of the command to my `$PATH`. 
Exporting them to `$PATH` make the custom script in those folders can be launched without writing the absolute path. 
For example to launch Rofi, I just need to make a keybind to execute `rofi-apps`, instead of `/home/addy/.utilty/rofi-apps`.

- **Rofi** <br /> My Rofi looks like this <br />
![preview-rofi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-rofi.jpg) <br /> 
My rofi colour is set in *~/.Xresources*, but it just an #INCLUDE command. The actual colour configuration is in *~/.xrdb/rofi*, You will understand if You look at it. 
And the launch configuration is in *~/.utility/rofi-apps*. If You use my *.profile* or *.xsessionrc*, 
just make a keybind to execute `rofi-apps` to make your Rofi launched with appearance like this. <br /> <br /> 
![preview-rofi2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-rofi2.jpg) <br /> 
That's my rofi with dark colour. <br /> 

- **obmenu-generator** <br /> My Openbox menu is generated using obmenu-generator pipemenu. 
To use my scheme simply copy my scheme & config, then install *obmenu-generator* from AUR and type `obmenu-generator -p` and reconfigure Openbox.
My menu scheme looks like this (result may vary) <br /> 
![preview-obmenu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-obmenu.jpg) <br /> 
**Now Playing** : Dream Theater - A Change of Seasons <br />

- **Neofetch** Just simple neofetch configuration. I made a shortcut called `fetch` to launch Neofetch with custom colour and logo. <br /> 
![preview-neofetch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-neofetch.jpg) <br /> 
When the colour accent of my theme is cyan I launch `fetch -cyan`. <br /> <br /> 
![preview-neofetch2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-neofetch2.jpg) <br /> 
When the colour accent of my theme is froly I launch `fetch -froly` :kissing_heart: <br /> 
You need w3m package to display image in terminal.

- **zshrc** <br /> Contains my *oh-my-zsh* config. Including my minimalist oh-my-zsh themes (in ~/.oh-my-zsh folder).
To use it, simply install oh-my-zsh, copy my .zshrc & .oh-my-zsh folder to your home. Then switch shell using `chsh` command.
It also contains some useful alias, so please read before use :wink:

- **~/.utility/ytmp3** <br /> Just a helper to download mp3 from Youtube using youtube-dl, use the video title as ID3 metadata, then embed the thumbnail as albumart.
To use it simply run `ytmp3 <URL>` for example `ytmp3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpgNV4Nvetg` <br /> 
![preview-ytmp3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-ytmp3.jpg) <br /> <br /> 
But sometimes the thumbnail doesn't look nice, add `-n` flag to skip embed the albumart, for example `ytmp3 -n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpgNV4Nvetg`.
By the way I use Dream Theater song, [The Bigger Picture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpgNV4Nvetg) for the example above. It's a great song, I recommend You to listen to it. 
The minute 5 to the end is one of the best part of the song ever recorded in human history. It sums up every emotion then unleash it. <br />

- **~/.executor** <br /> A collections of scripts to generate status for tint2 executor. 
Example : tint2 in my Openbox screenshoot preview above is using these script to display weather and now-playing.
But You can also use it for Polybar custom script, Lemonbar feeder, dzen2 feeder, Conky execi, or pipe it to Dunst, just use your creativity.
And don't forget to read the script before use.

- **Xresources** <br /> My configuration for URxvt, including copy paste support by [Muennich](https://github.com/muennich/urxvt-perls). 
Hit Alt+C to copy, and Alt+V to paste (*xsel* package is needed). 
I put the colour configuration in *~/.xrdb* folder and include it in Xresources using `#include` command. 
It makes me able to change or mix the colour scheme for urxvt, dmenu, and rofi easily. You will understand if You look at it.
All of my favourite terminal colour scheme I frequently use on my setup is available in *~/.xrdb/color* folder.

- **Compton** <br /> Eye candy shadow. Also some useful "exclude" to avoid broken compositing.

- **Conky** <br /> Not in this repo. My conky themes spreads everywhere in my other repos, Google Drive, and DeviantArt. 
I have a plan to merge them all to my [Conky Themes Collections](https://github.com/addy-dclxvi/conky-theme-collections) repo. But I still don't have enough time to do it now.

- **Tint2** <br /> Just a single tint2rc, looks like my Openbox preview above. 
For my another Tint2 collections please check my [Tint2 Themes Collections](https://github.com/addy-dclxvi/Tint2-Theme-Collections). 
You need tint2 with executor support, and consider to use backported tint2 from BunsenLabs repo if You are on Debian. 
Tint2 version in Debian repo is outdated (Upss, every packages in Debian repo is outdated actually :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: )

- **termite** <br /> My termite terminal emulator configuration with Nord colour scheme & Mostly-Bright colour scheme.

- **ncmpcpp** <br /> A simple ncmpcpp config, with album art support. The album art script is taken from [Marco](https://marcocheung.wordpress.com/). 
Slightly modified to get rid the transparency bug. 
To use ncmpcpp with album art, simply launch `ncmpcpp -c .ncmpcpp/config-art` or `ncmpcpp -c .ncmpcpp/config-art-dark` (make a shortcut for it for easy launch). 
Urxvt with pixbuf enabled is needed. You can get it from AUR, the package name is *rxvt-unicode-pixbuf*. 
For Debian user, You don't need, the URxvt in Debian repo is compiled with pixbuf by default.  
Also integrated with *dunst* notification (any notification daemon should be work, but I haven't tested it). Just copy my dunst config, install dunst, and do nothing. 
Dunst will launch automatically if triggered by *notify-send* event (except if You're not using Display Manager, add `dunst &` to your ~/.xinitrc). 
And because this is a hacky trick, the album art can't adapt to the terminal size :disappointed_relieved:

- **Skippy-XD** <br /> If You don't know, Skippy-XD is a program to expose the stacked windows. I usually use it when I go taskbar-less. <br />
![preview-skippy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-skippy.jpg) <br />
My Skippy-XD configuration looks like this, nothing special.

- **Geany** <br /> Contains my configuration & colour scheme for Geany <br />
![preview-geany](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-geany.jpg) <br />
My dark colour looks like this. <br /> <br />
![preview-geany2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-geany2.jpg) <br />
And my light colour looks like this.

- **Vim** <br /> Just a simple & plugin-less vimrc. Nothing special here, I'm not an IT guy :pensive: <br />
![preview-vim](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-vim.jpg) <br />
Look like this.

- **Audacious** <br /> Nothing special here. <br />
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-audacious.jpg) <br />
Just a configuration to remove some components of Audacious, to make it looks minimal :yum:

- **gtk.css** <br /> Add useless space wasting paddings for vte-based terminal, including termite & xfce4-terminal.

- **~/.toys** <br /> Boys love toys, so I include some toys I collected from 
[Crunchbang Forum](https://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?id=13645) & Stark's [Color-Scripts](https://github.com/stark/Color-Scripts). <br />
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-toys.jpg) <br />
I frequently use them for terminal colour scheme show-off. <br /> <br />
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-pokemon.jpg) <br />
Also contains a script to launch URxvt with Pokemon background (URxvt with pixbuf enabled is needed). Use light terminal colour scheme first. It's super effective!

- **~/.notify** <br /> A set of command to pipe my executor scripts to Dunst. When I go statusbar-less, I usually made keybinds to execute them. <br />
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-dunst.jpg) <br />
In the screenshot above, I made a keybinds to execute `notify-weather`, `notify-music`, and `notify-ssid`. It displayed as notifications when I hit those keybinds.

- **~/.utility/record** <br /> A script to do a screenrecord using ffmpeg, so You don't need any external program.
You just need ffmpeg and mkv codec, mostly autoinstalled when You have a multimedia player like VLC or MPV. <br />
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-screenrecord.jpg) <br />
To use this, launch your rofi and hit Shift + Left to enter *run* mode (if you're using my rofi configuration).
Search `record` and hit enter to start recording. If You want to end the recording session, launch your rofi again, hit Shift + Left, search for `stop-recording` then hit Enter.
The video will be saved in *~/Videos/record.mkv*. Rename it first before take another recording session :wink:

- **~/.utility/screeny** <br /> A script to take a screenshot using scrot, add date & time to the file name, move the result to *~/Pictures*, then preview the result using Viewnior.
Bind `screeny` command to your *Print Screen* button. <br />
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-screeny.jpg) <br />
And You can instantly delete the result if You are unsatified the screenshoot using Delete button.

- **Ranger** <br /> Pretty stock Ranger file manager configuration. <br />
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-ranger.jpg) <br />
You need w3m package to display image preview in terminal, the recommended terminal is URxvt.

- **Startpage** <br /> My own hardcoded startpage using HTML & CSS. Not a programmer, at least it works I'm quite happy :cry: <br />
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-startpage.jpg) <br />
Mystartpage looks like this. Dark variant is also available.

- **Bar** <br /> My collections of Lemonbar script/config. The workspace indicator is generated using xdotool, so it can be work on any WM.
Except *panel-bspwm*, it's specially designed for Bspwm. The workspace indicator is generated using `bspc subscribe` for efficient loop.
The wifi indicator is generated using `/sbin/iwgetid`, another distro than Debian may have different path of `iwgetid`. <br />
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-popup.jpg) <br />
*panel-mini* has a bonus ability. It can display album art popup using mpc, ImageMagick, and n30f. Click left to display popup and click right to close popup.
I put the popup script in *~/.toys* and the background image in *~/.popup* folder.

- **~/.fonts** <br /> Contains Icomoon font, for some of my Polybar config. It's actually packed by NerdyPepper, but I think It would be wise to save a copy here to make You easier to recreate my setup.
Also contains Siji and Tewi fonts. To use those bitmap fonts, add `xset fp+ ~/.fonts/misc &` to your startup. 
And maybe You also need to `sudo dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig-config` on Debian to enable the bitmap fonts.

- **Stalonetray** <br /> A configuration file for stalonetray. I usually use it as a companion for Lemonbar. Lemonbar has no dedicated system tray handler.
The system tray will be placed on top-left of the desktop and undocked (like on my Bspwm preview above).

- **Weechat** <br /> Minimalist Weechat IRC config with Bufflist, like in my Bspwm & Xfwm screenshoot above. 
Unfotunately the Weechat version in Debian repo is too low and doesn't support Bufflist (except by using external plugin). 
My config also contains some useful alias to hide/unhide nicklist and time.

- **Plank** <br /> Minimalist Plank theme looks like in my Rofi preview screenshot above.

- **~/.utility/gitpush & ~/.utility/gitsetup** <br /> A helper script made by Erik Dubois to push files to GitHub repository.

## Comments
Most of the configurations are well-commented. Make sure You read them.

## Tips & Tricks
Some tricks I frequently use for my wallpaper. Ssssstttt these are secret :wink: <br />

- **Linear Vignette** <br /> 
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/tips1.jpg) <br /> 
Use your terminal background & foreground colour as background & foreground colour in your GIMP toolbox. Then create new layer using background colour. 
Add black layer mask, select gradient tool in the toolbox then drag your mouse from top left to bottom right in the image. Reduce the opacity. <br /> <br />
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/tips-result1.jpg) <br />
Now my conky looks nice in the dark side of wallpaper :blush: <br />

- **Radial Vignette** <br /> 
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/tips2.jpg) <br /> 
Use your terminal background & foreground colour as background & foreground colour in your GIMP toolbox. Then create new layer using background colour. 
Add white layer mask, switch background & foreground colour in the toolbox, select the gradient tool but set it as radial gradient (top right dock). 
Then drag your mouse from center to the outer left or right side of the image and reduce the opacity. You should have a vignette effect now. 
But let's go more advanced. My panel has purple accent colour, so I create new purple layer to make my wallpaper matches with my panel. I reduce the opacity to 10%. <br /> <br />
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-fluxbox.jpg) <br />
Now my setup blends well with the wallpaper :relaxed: <br />

- **Out of Focus** <br /> 
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/tips3.jpg) <br /> 
Duplicate your layer then apply gaussian blur effect (Filter > Blur > Gaussian Blur) with 50% radius on the top layer. 
Then add white layer mask. Select gradient tool (use radial gradient like guide above). 
Switch background & foreground colour in your toolbox then drag your mouse from center to the outer left or right side of the image. 
You should have an out of focus effect now. But, the image still too bright. So, Let's dim it. 
add new layer with background colour (the dark one), then reduce the opacity. <br />
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/tips-result3.jpg) <br />
This is my old screenshot, so not very accurate. Just for example. <br />

- **Vintage** <br /> 
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/tips4.jpg) <br /> 
Simply just increase the brightness and reduce the contrast. <br /> <br />
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/tips-result4.jpg) <br />
Hmmmm.. Looks nice with pywal apparently :smirk: <br />

- **Think Out of The Box** <br /> 
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/tips-result2.jpg) <br /> 
I already have a line shaped workspace indicator. So, I only need a static icons for workspace icons. <br /> <br />
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/tips5.jpg) <br />
So, I glued the icons to the wallpaper using GIMP :joy: <br />
If it looks stupid but it works, it's not stupid :laughing:

## What are Dotfiles?

If you're not familiar with the concept of dotfiles, check out Github's dotfiles page to learn more about them. Essentially, when someone says "dotfiles" they mean maintaining your command-line preferences in a Git repository (sort of like how I use Dropbox to manage my preference files for TextExpander, etc.) that you install on every computer.

The name dotfiles refers to the fact that most of the files that perform this sort of configuration start with a dot. The Zsh configuration file, for example, is `.zshrc` The SSH configuration folder is `.ssh` And so on. So the concept of "dotfiles" just means "versioning your configuration files."

Your dotfiles will help you create powerful and consistent shell shortcuts and functions, settings for your editors, color coding and layouts for your shell, preferences and authentication for ssh and mysql and other protocols, and more.

**Warning:** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk!

## Superhero Dotfiles and Their Super Powers

Dotfiles are split into two main types. Those that contain a set of commands and only run once, .osx for example runs a list of commands and gives OS X super powers. Other files such as .bash_profile and .bashrc run each time you open a new Terminal session and gives your Terminal super powers.

Here's a run down of the dotfiles in my repo and a description of what they can do.

### .bash_profile / .bashrc

When you open a new Terminal session, this file is loaded by Bash. It loads in the other dotfiles `path,bash_prompt,exports,aliases,functions,extra` and configures some useful settings such as auto correcting typos when using cd completion.

In some instances `.bashrc` can be loaded, so this file makes sure that .bash_profile is called.

### .path

This file speeds up the process of running executable files. Rather than having to cd back and forth across various paths to executable files, you can set the file paths in your .path dotilfe and then run executable files directly.

Generally, this file isn't held in the public repo as it can contain sensitive information.

Here’s an example `~/.path` file that adds `~/utils` to the `$PATH:
export PATH="$HOME/utils:$PATH"``

### .bash_prompt

Using this file you can customise and set the various colors of your Bash prompt.

### .exports

Sets environment variables, such as setting Vim as the default editor using export `EDITOR="sublime"` It also increases the amount of history saved, useful for backtracking over previous commands you've used.

### .aliases

This file contains useful aliases to help you write less. For example, instead of typing `cd ..` you can set it here to be '..'. Starting to like these files yet?

### .functions

Similar to aliases, except functions can take arguments.

Before when I mentioned I was looking over different dotfile repos, I did mkdir to create a directory. After that, I'd then need to cd into that directory.

### .gitconfig

This file is only used by Git, for example, when a git command is invoked. So although there's an `.aliases` file, those aliases are run directly.

### .gitignore

Set files that you'd like Git to ignore on the entire system. Yay, no more `.DS_Store` being accidentally committed!

### .gvimrc

A small file that improves readability for gvim.

### .hgignore

Simliar to .gitignore for Mercurial.

### .hushlogin

In some instances, for example, when you ssh into a machine, you may be presented with a message. It might look something like this:

```                                   _
                                  | |
 _ __ ___  _   _    ___ ___   ___ | |  ___  ___ _ ____   _____ _ __
| '_ ` _ \| | | |  / __/ _ \ / _ \| | / __|/ _ \ '__\ \ / / _ \ '__|
| | | | | | |_| | | (_| (_) | (_) | | \__ \  __/ |   \ V /  __/ |
|_| |_| |_|\__, |  \___\___/ \___/|_| |___/\___|_|    \_/ \___|_|
            __/ |
           |___/
Welcome to my cool server.
Any malicious and/or unauthorized activity is strictly forbidden.
All activity may be logged.
```

This file prevents this from being shown.

### .inputrc

Configures the 'Readline environment'. This controls the way keys work when you're entering a command into your shell.
An example of how I find this useful is to make tab autocomplete regardless of filename case:

`set completion-ignore-case on`

### .osx

This is my favorite of all the dotfiles. It is run once, manually, for the commands to run and take effect. Depending on what you've added to this file, you may need to restart your machine.

Some of the awesome things I love are:

- Disable the “Are you sure you want to open this application?” dialog
- Check for software updates daily, not just once per week
- Disable Notification Center and remove the menu bar icon
- Enable access for assistive devices
- Set a blazingly fast keyboard repeat rate
- Finder: allow quitting via `⌘ + Q` doing so will also hide desktop icons
- When performing a search, search the current folder by default
- Speed up Mission Control animations

### .screenrc

If you use screen, this removes the startup message.

### .vimrc

I'm not that familiar with vim. However some of the things you can do with this file include enabling line numbers and adding syntax highlighting.

For `vim` i have also included the [powerline](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline) visual styling which will include a status line.

**Important Notes**

- I haven't included `powerline` in my main installation script, so if you wish to have it, then please proceed with installing it separately with the fonts dependency.
- The `--user` parameter should be removed if you got an error while installation especially if you have python installed via Homebrew.
- A dependency is the [powerline fonts](https://github.com/ahmadassaf/powerline-fonts) pack. Installation instructions can be found directly in the repository.

after installing powerline enable it by adding to the `.vimrc`:

```shell
set rtp+=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/powerline/bindings/vim
```

This can be change **depending on the path to the `python` directory**

### .wgetrc

If you use wget, this adds additional settings such as changing the timeout to 60 seconds rather than the default 15 minutes. It also sets the retry to three, rather than the default 20!

## Getting Started

If you notice, some files that have mentioned above don't exist in this repo. This is because i am using the amazing [bash-it](http://github.com/ahmadassaf/bash-it) repo to organize those dotfiles.
I recommend you head overthere and read how to use them.d

## Installing the Scripts

For installing the above files outside of the workflow mentioned in the [main configurations](http://github.com/ahmadassaf/configurations), you need to run the following command `sh install.sh`. The command will symlink all the files in this directory into your home directory, overwriting existing files.

### Sensible OS X defaults

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible OS X defaults:

```bash
./.osx
```

### Install Homebrew formulae

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to install some common [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) formulae (after installing Homebrew, of course).
`brew bundle` has been deprecated, thus i converted the files into executable shell ones:

```bash
brew install ~/.brewfile.sh
```

you can always remove or add files based on yor preferences. You can search for brew formulas [here](http://brewformulas.org/) in order to add or get more information about the ones I am using.

My file contains the following `brew` formulas:

+ **Core Modules** coreutils, moreutils, findutils, binutils
+ **Bash, Bash plugins** bash, bash-completion, zsh, grc
+ **Development** git, heroku, node, mercurial, iojs
+ **Git speific addons** git-extras, hub, bfg

+ **Network tools** dns2tcp, knock, rename, webkit2png
+ [**Dupes**](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-dupes) grep, screen

### Install native apps with `brew cask`

You could also install native apps with [`brew cask`](https://github.com/phinze/homebrew-cask):

```bash
brew install ~/.caskfile.sh
```

you can always remove or add files based on yor preferences. You can search for cask formulas [here](http://caskroom.io/) in order to add or get more information about the ones I am using.

My `cask` file contains the following applications:

+ **Utilities** path-finder, alfred, cakebrew, a-better-finder-rename, fastscripts, bettertouchtool, iterm2, launchrocket, gyazo, ubersicht, dockmod, liteicon, cleanmymac, bartender, flexiglass
